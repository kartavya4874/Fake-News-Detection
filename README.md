# Fake-News-Detection
ake-News-Detection with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques.

ðŸ“„ Overview

In this project, we aim to build a classifier that can accurately detect fake news based on the content. The dataset includes various news articles labeled as real or fake, and the model is trained using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

ðŸ“‚ Contents

fake_news_detection.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook where the project is implemented. It contains all steps from data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. ðŸš€ Steps Covered in the Notebook Data Preprocessing:

Loading the dataset

Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis Vectorizing the text using methods like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model Building:

Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) to classify news as real or fake Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models

Evaluation:

Evaluating the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score Confusion matrix to visualize performance ðŸ›  How to Run Clone the repository:

jupyter notebook fake_news_detection.ipynb Run each cell to reproduce the results.

ðŸ“Š Dataset You can find the dataset used in this project from [link to dataset]. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib These can be installed using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib

ðŸ”® Future Improvements Experiment with deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for improved accuracy. Add more datasets to test the robustness of the model.

Model Deployment

Once you are satisfied with the performance of a particular classifier, you can deploy it in a real-world application or integrate it into a larger system for automatic fake news detection.
